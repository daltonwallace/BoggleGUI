We attempted to obtain as much code coverage as possible for the model.
However, some of the events we could not fully trigger through testing.
So, we were able to obtain ~85% coverage.  Additionally, it stated that
Coded UI testing was not required.  We spoke with Matthew about both of
these scenarios and he said it was fine.

Overall It should run well.
